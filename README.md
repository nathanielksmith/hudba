node + coffee script + music + you

about
-----
Hudba was originally a Tornado based project. In this form, it made its way to a pretty useful alpha state.

I decided to port it to node, however, before working any more on it (primarily to take advantage of asynch/socket.io stuff).

The node version is not yet usable.
